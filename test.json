This  may\nnot be the career-crowning mas-\nterpiece  Scorsese  fans  were\nexpecting,  but  it  doesnt  fail  to\nastonish.\n\n-Howard Ho\n\nMIRAMAX FILMS\n\nGangs of New York\nStarring \n\nLeonardo\n\nDiCaprio, Daniel-Day Lewis\n\nDirected \n\nby \n\nMartin\n\nScorsese\n\nGangs  of  New  York  is  a\nthree-hour  collection  of  meticu-\nlous, aggressive attention to his-\ntorical  detail.  Its  a  wonderfully\nchaotic  world,  and  its  too  bad\nthe characters arent big enough\nto fill it up.\n\nLeonardo  DiCaprio  is  poorly\ncast  as  the  films  Hamlet,  which\ndemands the determined passion\nof the young Al Pacino. Cameron\nDiaz  is  too  sunny  to  play  the\nwoman  with  a  dark  past.  Only\nDaniel  Day  Lewis,  in  a  movie-\nstealing role as Bill the Butcher,\nis  immersed  enough  in  his  char-\nacter to make you forget hes act-\ning. Hes also the only one flam-\nboyant enough in style to match\nthe  atmosphere  Scorsese  cre-\nates. \n\nThis film is most interested in\nthe sights of early New York City:\ntattered \ntenements,  casually\nnaked  whores,  a  Chinese  opera\nhouse, hundreds of coffins lined\nup  like  computer  transistors,\nand,  yes,  violence  galore.  It  is  a\nride through a place and time you\n\nMIRAMAX FILMS\n\nof \n\na\n\nConfessions \nDangerous Mind\n\nStarring Sam Rockwell\nDirected \n\nby \n\nGeorge\n\nClooney\n\nWhether or not TV game show\nproducer  Chuck  Barris  actually\nmoonlighted as a CIA assassin in\nthe  1970s,  the  truth  is  George\nClooney has taken his story and\nmade a compelling film. \n\nBased  on  Barris  infamous\nautobiography  and  penned  by\ncurrent  celebrity  screenwriter\nCharlie  Kaufman,  Confessions\nof a Dangerous Mind proves that\nClooney  has  a  knack  for  finding\nan honest point of view even in a\nstory  famous  for  its  possible\nhyperbole. \n\nThe  film  depicts  Barris  with-\nout  glamour.  It  unabashedly\nexposes  the  awkward  sexual\nencounters,  paranoid  behavior,\nand  gory  nightmares  of  a  man\nwho  claims  to  see  little  contra-\ndiction  in  his  desire  both  to\nentertain  people  and  to  pump\nbullets into human flesh.\n\nAs Barris, Sam Rockwell turns\nin  a  star-making  performance.\nRockwell  does  a  better  job  of\nmaking the unlikely story believ-\nable  than  Barris  himself  does  in\nhis  book,  by  bringing  humanity\nand truthfulness to the character.\nThe  film  is  not  without  its\nflaws,  as  Clooney  makes  a  few\nfreshman  mistakes  by  creating\nseveral  scenes  that  are  so  styl-\nized they end up unclear.

But  he  said  university\nPresident Richard Atkinson accept-\ned  his  resignation  during  a  Dec.  23\nconversation in which Atkinson said\nthe  lab  may  need  \"management\nchange\" to address its problems.\n\n\"The  controversy  was  so  strong\nand so critical of management that I\npersonally thought the best thing for\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nJohn Browne recently resigned as Los\nAlamos National Laboratory director. \n\nme to do was resign and to have the\nuniversity come in and take it to the\nnext level of performance,\" Browne\nsaid in an interview. \n\nEnergy \n\nSecretary \n\nSpencer\n\nAbraham, who met with Browne last\nmonth,  said:  \"It  is  crucial  that  we\nrestore  public  confidence  in  the\nmanagement of the laboratory.\" \n\nThe FBI, Energy Department and\nat  least  two  congressional  commit-\ntees  are  looking  into  alleged  credit\ncard abuses at the lab over the past\nseveral years and the disappearance\nof  high-tech  hardware  and  other\nequipment. \n\nTwo  lab-hired  investigators  were\nfired  in  November  and  they  went\npublic,  alleging  a  cover-up  of  the\nwrongdoing. The lab gave no reason\nfor  the  dismissals  and  has  not\nreplaced the two men. \n\n\"They continue to cover up and to\nconceal the situation at the lab, and\nfinally  they've  had  to  pay  for  what\nthey've  done,\"  said  Steven  Doran,\none of the fired investigators. \n\nThe  lab  has  also  been  tarnished\nby security scandals, including miss-\ning computer disks and the contro-\n\nLLAABBSS  || Page 7\n\nBByy  SShhaannee  NNeellssoonn\n\nD A I LY   B R U I N   R E P O R T E R\n\ns n e l s o n @ m e d i a . u c l a . e d u\nTo the relief of the university, lec-\nturers and clerical workers changed\ntheir minds and elected to come to\nwork every day this month.\n\nThe lecturers union threatened a\nsystemwide  January  strike  numer-\nous  times  last  quarter,  but  both\nunions formally notified the UC last\nmonth  they  have  no  plans  to  strike\nin January.\n\nThe University Council-American\nFederation of Teachers said it needs\nmore time to coordinate efforts with\nthe other two unions currently nego-\ntiating  with  the  university,  the\nCoalition  of  University  Employees\nand the University Professional and\nTechnical Employees.\n\nIn addition to CUE and UPTE, the\nlecturers union believes three other\nunions  may  consider  joining  in  a\nsystemwide  strike,  which  would\ntake a lot of coordination, said UC-\nAFT President Kevin Roddy.\n\nSince  the  Public  Employment\nRelations  Board  didnt  grant  the\nUCs request for impasse with CUE,\nthe UC informed CUE last month it\nwould  be  willing  to  enter  informal\nmediation, facilitated by the chair of\nthe state mediation and conciliation\nservice,  said  UC  Press  Aide  Robert\nSchwartz. \n\nIf CUE agrees to informal media-\ntion, it must also agree not to strike\nunless  an  impasse  is  reached,  he\nadded.\n\nClaudia  Horning,  CUE  president,\nsaid the union would agree to infor-\nmal mediation in a step to get both\nsides closer together.\n\nWhether  CUE  goes  to  impasse\nwith  the  UC  affects  when  the  sys-\ntemwide  strike  will  occur,  said\nRobert Hennig, a member of the UC-\nAFT bargaining team. He estimated\nthe  earliest  date  of  the  strike  to  be\nsometime in March at the end of the\nquarter.\n\nAll  three  unions  are  negotiating\nnew  labor  contracts  with  the  UC.\nMarch marks the third year for UC-\n\nAFT. Both university and union offi-\ncials say negotiations have extended\nsuch a long time because the other\nside  is  bargaining  in  bad  faith  with\nno  intention  of  compromising  on\ncontentious  issues,  namely  wages\nand job security.\n\nOver  the  past  year  all  three\nunions have planned and participat-\ned \nin  various  strikes,  rallies,\nprotests  and  teach-ins  to  recruit\nmembers,  draw  attention  to  them-\nselves,  and  to  put  pressure  on  the\nUC.\n\nSome  have  been  small  and\nresulted  in  little  university  notice.\nUPTE  staged  the  most  recent\ndemonstration  at  UCLA,  a  50-per-\nson  noon-time  rally  with  picket\nsigns, speeches and drums just out-\nside Ackerman Union, while inside\nthe  unions  bargaining  team  met\nwith the UC.\n\nBut  other  actions  were  disrup-\ntive, resulting in a formal comeback.\nThe UC responded to union strikes\n\nUUNNIIOONN  || Page 4\n\nWWeeaatthheerr High: 84\n\nLow: 59\n\nMonday\n\nTuesday\n\nWednesday\n\nCCoonnttaacctt\n\nNNEEWWSS  DDEESSKK\n310-825-2795\n\nnews@media.ucla.edu\n\nVVIIEEWWPPOOIINNTT  DDEESSKK  \n\n310-825-2216\n\nviewpoint@media.ucla.edu\n\nAA&&EE  DDEESSKK  \n310-825-2538\n\na&e@media.ucla.edu\n\nSSPPOORRTTSS  DDEESSKK  \n310-825-2095\n\nsports@media.ucla.edu\n\nAADDVVEERRTTIISSIINNGG  LLIINNEE  \n\n310-825-2161\n\nads@media.ucla.edu\n\nRREEMMIINNDDEERR::  JJaannuuaarryy  iiss\nNNaattiioonnaall  HHoott  TTeeaa  MMoonntthh!!\n\nSSttaarrtt  yyoouurr  kkeettttlleess..\n\nIInnddeexx Classified . . . 15\n\nCrossword . . 17\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n\nViewpoint . . . 12\nA&E . . . . . . . 13\nSports . . . . . 26\n\nWhats Brewin . 2\nGame Stats . . 23\nMovie Times . . 14\n\n\f", "month": 1, "score": 0.5003123048094941, "year": 2003, "date": {"$date": 1041811200000}, "_id": {"$oid": "5732584017ebdbbe14fa0458"}, "page": 1, "day": 6}, {"url": "testfiles/010603.page04.news4.pdf", "text": "44 TTHHEE  DDAAIILLYY  BBRRUUIINN MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2003\n\nNNEEWWSS\n\nSeniors!\nClass of 2003\n\nThis is your last chance to be in\nthe 2003 yearbook! \n\nLAST CHANCE\n\nDont MISS OUT on\n\nthis great opportunity!\n\nTo make your portrait appointment*,\nstop by in person at\nCampus Photo Studio/\nGraduation Etc.\nlocated on A-level Ackerman Union or call\n310-206-8433\n(ext. 68433 on campus).\n\n The deadline to take your pictures for the \n\n2003 yearbook is  January 10, 2003\n\nVisit our website for more information:\nwww.uclastore.com\n\n Purchase your Bruinlife yearbook at the time of\n\nyour portrait sitting and SAVE $7.\n\n*Every Monday, Campus Photo Studio starts taking\nappointments for the following week.\n\nCampus Photo Studio 310.206.8433\nwww.uclastore.com\n\nL.A. gang prevention\nneeds improvement\n\nTThhee  AAssssoocciiaatteedd  PPrreessss\n\nMore  than  half  of  the  citys  26\nagencies  that  provide  gang  preven-\ntion  services  to  middle-school  stu-\ndents  have  failed  to  meet  perfor-\nmance  standards,  leading  officials\nto terminate a contract with one of\nthe  programs  and  place  six  others\non probation.\n\nThe  agencies,  which  are  part  of\nthe L.A. Bridges program, were cre-\nated to help keep an estimated 5,200\nmiddle-school students out of gangs\nby providing them with after-school\nsports  programs,  counseling  and\nanger-management classes.\n\nBut  a  recent  review  by  the  citys\nCommunity \nDevelopment\nDepartment  found  several  middle\nschool sites suffer from low partici-\npation by parents and students and\nhave failed to adequately document\ntheir results.\n\nThe  evaluation  comes  as  Los\nis  struggling  with  an\nAngeles \nincrease  in  gang  violence  that  has\ncontributed to a 10 percent increase\nin  homicides  in  2002,  when  659\nkillings were reported.\n\nThe evaluation showed that cer-\ntainly  there  are  areas  that  need\nimprovement,  but  overall  we  are\nable to quantify improvement in the\nperformances, \nLillian\n\nsaid \n\nKawasaki,  manager \nCommunity Development Dept.\n\nof \n\nthe\n\nThe  program  was  launched  in\n1996  in  response  to  a  rash  of  gang\nkillings, \nincluding  the  shooting\ndeath  of  3-year-old  Stephanie\nKuhen, whose family made a wrong\nturn  down  an  alley  and  were\nambushed by gang members.\n\nThe  city  requires  each  L.A.\nBridges  contractor  to  maintain  a\ncaseload of at least 50 students con-\nsidered to be at high risk for joining\ngangs and 150 lower-risk students.\n\nEach agency must provide docu-\nmentation,  including  sign-in  sheets\nshowing that students are receiving\ncounseling, \nanger-management\ntraining,  educational,  tutorial  and\nhomework assistance and organized\nsports and recreation activities.\n\nThe latest evaluation, submitted a\nfew  weeks  ago  to  Mayor  James\nHahn,  concluded  that  one  agency\nhad to be terminated for low atten-\ndance  and  lack  of  any  sports  or\nrecreation  programs.  Fourteen\nother  agencies  had  problems  that\nrequire corrective action.\n\nIt doesnt mean they arent help-\ning,  said  Deputy  Mayor  Matt\nMiddlebrook.

The university is constantly negotiating labor contracts, often with more \nthan one union at the same time. This timeline represents the last three and half years.\n\nJulyJuly -- Teaching assistants and readers formed their own union,  \nUnited Auto Workers local 2865, and started negotiating with the \nUC\nAprilApril -- UC-AFT started negotiating for a new contract\n\nJune \nJune -- Previous UC-AFT contract expired\nMay May -- CUE started negotiating for a new contract \n\nMarch \nMarch -- UPTE started negotiating for a multi-year contract\n\nJune \nJune -- The California Nurses Association ratifies the UCs most \nrecent three-year contract proposal after four months of \nnegotiations\n\nAugust \nAugust -- CUE and UC-AFT members strike at UC Berkeley \nfor 2 days\n\nOctober \nOctober -- CUE and UC-AFT strike and hold rallies at San \nDiego, Santa Cruz, Riverside, Irvine and Davis campuses for \n2 days \n\nNovember \nNovember -- UC signs three-year contract effective Oct. 1, \n2002 with Federated University Police Officer Association six \nweeks after beginning negotiations\n\nJanuary \nJanuary -- UC-AFT, CUE and UPTE are currently negotiating \ncontract terms\n\nSOURCE:  UC Office of the President\n\n1\n1\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n2\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\nStrikes draw media\nUUNNIIOONN  ||\nattention, fail to influence UC\n\nfrom page 11\n\nat six campuses earlier this year by\nfiling  two  formal  complaints  with\nthe  PERB  arguing  the  parties  were\nboth still negotiating.\n\nIt  is  clear  to  the  university  that\nintermittent  strikes  or  threats  of\nstrikes  are  serious  evidence  of  bad\nfaith bargaining, Schwartz said.\n\nCUE officials maintain its strikes\nwere  justified  because  they  were\nbased  on  unfair  labor  practice\ncharges against the UC for the same\nallegations.\n\nThough unions say they strike to\nput  pressure  on  the  UC  at  the  bar-\ngaining  table,  both  sides  agree  that\nwhile the various events succeed in\ndrawing media attention and aware-\nness  to  the  unions  concerns,  they\nfail  to  rouse  the  university  during\nnegotiations. \n\nRallies,  strikes  or  other  such\ndemonstrations do not influence the\nuniversitys  positions.  The  UC  for-\nmulates  its  offers  based  on  what  it\nbelieves  to  be  the  best  and  fairest\noffer  given  available  resources,\nSchwartz said.\n\nUnion  leaders  said  they  under-\nstand money issues are off the table\ngiven  the  states  financial  crisis.\nWhat  they  want  is  better  employee\ntreatment, Roddy said.\n\nThe planned January strikes were\n\ngoing  to  be  another  protest  event,\nHennig  said.  But  since  past  strikes\nhavent affected the UCs offer at the\ntable, UC-AFT changed its focus this\nquarter  to  organizing  a  coalition  of\nmultiple unions for a more substan-\ntial strike it hopes the university will\nnotice, he added. \n\nWe  are  done  playing  games.  We\nare  not  planning  public  relations\nthings  anymore,  said  Robert\nHennig,  a  UC-AFT  bargaining  team\nmember. The only thing where we\ncan do anything is by trying to hurt\nthem.\n\nUC-AFT wants every single cam-\npus  out  on  strike,  and  is  seriously\nconsidering  open-ended  strikes  if\nnecessary, Hennig said. The UC-AFT\ncouncil is meeting in two weeks to\nwork out the details.\n\nHennig said the lecturers unions\nwould prefer not to strike, but they\nfeel like it is their last option. CUE,\nUC-AFT  and  UPTE  union  leaders\nsay  little  progress  was  made  at  the\nlast \nin\nDecember. They said it was difficult\nto bargain with the UC because they\nsend  representatives  to  the  table\nwho  have  no  power  to  make  deci-\nsions. \n\nbargaining \n\nsessions \n\nBut the UC assures all of its nego-\ntiators  are  experienced  profession-\nals  with  full  authority  to  represent\nthe UC at the table, Schwartz said.\n\nHydrogen Fuel\n\nmeans freedom from:\n\nOil Dependence, Global Warming, Air Pollution\n\nIn  years  past,  UCLAs  engineering  students  successfully \npowered  an  automobile  without  smog  or  gasoline,  using \nhydrogen fuel.

Sonny from\nMiami  Vice  was  known  for  driving  the\nFerrari  Daytona  365/GT4  Spyder,  Herbie\nthe Love Bug was known for, well, being a\nVolkswagen  Bug  and  James  Bond  was\nknown for all of the stellar Aston Martins.\nThese TV shows and movies make a desir-\nable car even more desirable, even if it is\njust a VW Bug.\n\nThe featured display at this years auto\nshow  exhibits  the  revered  James  Bond\ncars complete with the famous Bond mod-\nifications, alongside screens showing clips\nfrom  the  films.  From  the  current  Bond\nfilm  Die  Another  Day,  on  display  is the\nAston  Martin  V12  Vanquish,  the  green\nJaguar  XKR  Roadster,  and  Jinx  007\nFord  Thunderbird.

More  significantly,  however,\nCzechs and Slovaks living in Los Angeles\nhad  the  rare  opportunity  to  enjoy  their\nnative  popular  culture  up  close,  shaking\nhands  and  taking  pictures  with  some  of\nthe countrys famous actors, singers, ath-\nletes and television personalities.\n\nIve waited 20 years for this, said one\nfan gleefully, as her husband took her pic-\nture  with  the  very  friendly  Karel  Gott,  a\nlegendary singer in Europe.\n\nGott  and  the  other  Czech  celebrities\nwere here as members of Amfora, a non-\n\nprofit organization which travels to Czech\nand  Slovak  communities  around  the\nworld  while  fund-raising  for  numerous\nchildrens  causes.  Amfora  assisted  the\nCzech  government  last  year,  donating\nmoney for flood relief in Prague. Since its\ninception in 1974, Amfora has traveled to\nmany  countries,  most  recently  South\nAfrica,  Australia  and  Japan.  This  was\ntheir first trip to the United States. \n\nMany  Czech  television  shows  stopped\nproduction  for  two  weeks  due  to  the\nabsence  of  their  Amfora-affiliated  actors\nand hosts. \n\nBecause this trip to the United States\ninterfered  so  heavily  with  the  entertain-\nment  industry  back  home,  we  might  not\nbe able to return, Amfora general manag-\ner Peter Salava said. But we are definite-\nly enjoying our time here.\n\nJirina  Kyas,  a  UCLA  communication\nstudies student, organized the event. Kyas\ngot  involved  with  the  event  through  the\nCzech Consulate in Los Angeles. She has\nbeen  involved  with  the  Consulate  since\n\nshe immigrated here in 1997. \n\nI  was  a  very  active  participant  in\nCzech  culture  back  home, she  said.  I\ncame  here  to  the  United  States  in  1997,\nand  when  the  consulate  in  Los  Angeles\nopened, I joined them immediately.\n\nNormally, American fans of Czech cul-\nture  have  only  a  few  resources  with\nwhich to follow it, primarily through the\nInternet  and  Czech  television  in  some\nplaces. \n\nEach  of  these  Amfora  players  would\ndraw huge crowds back home, so an inti-\nmate opportunity like this one is very spe-\ncial to us, Kyas said.\n\nIn  addition  to  Saturdays  soccer  game\nat  Drake  Stadium,  the  star-studded\nAmfora put on a concert Sunday night in\nHuntington Beach, and will travel to Las\nVegas and New York City before returning\nto Prague.\n\nPresently, there are no plans to return\nto the UCLA campus for more Czech com-\nmunity  outreach,  according  to  Consul\nGeneral Margita Fuchsova. \n\nBackseat DJ\n\nruins ideal road\n\ntrip with bad\nmusic choices\nAnew quarter is starting, and for those of us\n\nhailing from the hella north half of the\nstate, that can only mean one thing: a\n\nseven hour car trip.\n\nFortunately, the sheer boredom can be alle-\nviated by nothing more than a robust CD col-\nlection and a passenger willing to DJ. Before\nyou know it, the formida-\nble journey is just a few\nhours to catch up on your\nlistening, rock out with\nyour buddy, and be, in the\nmost Kerouac-ian sense,\non the road.\n\nWell, thats how I pic-\ntured it anyway. I set out\nfor Westwood on Saturday\nwith visions of me and\nRandall Pink Floyd\ngoing to score Aerosmith\ntickets with Sweet\nEmotion blasting over the\neight track. I saw Garth\nAlgar and myself belting out Bohemian\nRhapsody with Phil about to spew in the back.\nI imagined myself in a little Alfa Romeo rush-\ning to stop the wedding of the woman I love\n(you know how this one goes, right?) And\nheres to you, Mrs. Robinson.\n\nCrossen\n\nDan\n\nThats not what I got.\nIn retrospect, I should have seen it coming\n\nfrom the very start. I left San Francisco and\npicked up my friend in Walnut Creek. It was\nearly, I had a headache, and I just wanted to\nchill out with the latest Boards of Canada\nrecord, Geogaddi, for a little while. For the\nfirst five minutes no one mentioned the music\nand my hopes were high. But then it hap-\npened:\n\nDude, what the hell is this?\nOk, Im not an unreasonable guy. Ill con-\n\ncede that abstract electronic music isnt what\nmost people want to listen to on the road, and\nI willingly exchanged it for a record we could\nagree on, Radioheads classic, The Bends.\n\nThis was the high point of the trip. The\n\ntunes were great, the road was clear, and we\nwere singing along. But my happiness could\nnot last forever. I listened to the last song with\ntrepidation and then tentatively took out my\nCDs. \n\nRadiohead had me in the mood to keep\nrocking and I had at least a few options I\ncould try. I suggested Built to Spill: Eh. I sug-\ngested the Velvet Underground: I never really\nliked them much. I suggested The\nDismemberment Plan, Pavement, X, Nirvana\nfor Christs sake, anything! Blank-faced stare.\n\nAt this point I was becoming frantic; I knew\nwhat was coming. I tried a controlled retreat,\nbringing out some hip-hop, but it was too late.\nHere, lets put this on for a while, he said. \nI knew it would be bad. I suspected it might\n\nbe something along the lines of Dispatch or\nJack Johnson. But what went into the CD\nplayer that fateful afternoon was worse than\nanything I could have imagined. It was the The\nString Cheese Incident. A jam band; the bane\nof any true rock fans existence. \n\nI tried in vain to protest. Couldnt it at least\nbe the Grateful Dead, the one really good jam\nband? But man did he want to hear The String\nCheese Incident, and he was the one handling\nthe switching. I could either pull over and\nforce a change or do my best to tolerate it for\na while.\n\nAfter about 40 minutes it seemed my for-\n\ntunes might have turned. My friend had fallen\nasleep. This was my chance. I reached for my\nown CDs and found nothing! They were on\nthe other side of the car. He had locked me up\nin this horrible prison and then put the key\ntantalizingly out of reach. There was nothing I\ncould do, so I gave a sigh and gave into my\nfate.\n\nThe moral of the story is if you want the\n\nroad trip weve all seen in the movies, you bet-\nter make sure youre with someone who has\nthe same musical tastes. As for me, I wanted\nKerouac, but all I got was wack.\n\nDan Crossens top five penultimate songs are:\n5. The Smashing Pumpkins, By Starlight     \n4.

It  seemed  aimed  at  bol-\nstering Iraqi officials frequent state-\nments  that  an  invading  force  would\nnot  only  face  the  Iraqi  army  but\narmed civilians defending every city\nand village. \n\nThe brief Al-Iraq article did not say\nhow  many  troops  took  part  in  the\nSaturday war game, nor did it include\nphotographs.  A  senior  Baath  party\nmember,  Fadhil  Mahmoud  al-\nMishiykhi,  told  the  paper  that  the\nfighters  were  ready  to  confront  any\ncampaign by America and its Zionist\nally  meaning Israel. \n\nAfter  the  incident  at  the  govern-\nment  complex  in  Baghdads  Al-\nJadriya  neighborhood,  the  arms\ninspectors did not speak to reporters,\nas usual.

The state-\nment explained the fee increase as a\nmeasure  taken  along  with  budget\ncuts to cope with the states budget\ncrisis, and acknowledged that a mid-\nyear increase is particularly unwel-\ncome, and warned that an addition-\nal fee increase for 2003-2004 is like-\nly.\n\nAccording  to  Carnesales  state-\nment,  the  financial  aid  office  will\ncontact  undergraduates  with  infor-\nmation on their spring aid packages.\nUC  budget  vice  president  Larry\nHershman  said  increased  financial\naid would cover the total cost of the\nfee  hike  for  about  one-half  of  stu-\ndents receiving aid.\n\nUC  President  Richard  Atkinson\nsaid  the  board  needed  to  move\nquickly so the university could noti-\nfy students and their families of the\nfee increase as soon as possible, and\ncharacterized the fee hike as a way\nto  spread  the  pain  around  different\ngroups at the university.\n\nBut  the  University  of  California\nStudents Association, which lobbies\nfor UC student interests, objected to\nthe  board  voting  on  student  fees\nwhen classes were not in session.\n\nIt  is  entirely  inappropriate  to\nschedule  a  meeting  when  students\nare  no  longer  on  campus,  said\nUCSA chairman Stephen Klass.\n\nHowever,  not \n\nall \n\nstudents\n\nopposed the regents decision.\n\nCalifornia is going through a bud-\nget shortfall, so I think (the fee hike)\nis  necessary,  said  first-year  unde-\nclared student Dorothy Lee.\n\nSeveral  regents  expressed  reluc-\ntance to raise fees, but only Regents\nGeorge  Marcus,  Ward  Connerly,\nDexter  Ligot-Gordon,  the  lone  stu-\ndent  with  a  vote  on  the  board,  and\nLt.  Gov.  Cruz  Bustamante,  a  regent\nby virtue of his office, voted against\nthe increase.\n\nBustamante and Connerly  often\non different sides of UC issues, par-\nticularly those regarding admissions\n agreed the increase places too high\nof a burden on students and families.\nRegent Haim Saban, who left the\nmeeting  before  a  vote  was  taken\nmay  have  been  a  fifth  vote  against\nthe increase.\n\nBefore  leaving,  Saban  addressed\nBustamante,  who  had  spoken\nagainst  the  increase  and  said,  Im\nwith you, man.\n\nDavis  will  release  his  budget\nplans  for  2003-2004  on  Jan.  10,  and\nhas  already  stated  his  intention  to\nfurther  cut  UC  funding.

They  began  their  work  by\nhanging \nflyers  during  winter\nbreak,  updating  residents  about\nthe assault case and providing res-\nidence hall safety tips. \n\nMembers  of  the  Safety  and\nSecurity  Committee  will  also\ndecide  if  extra  security  measures,\nsuch as front desks in the De Neve\n\nbuildings,  extra  UCPD  patrollers\nor  security  cameras,  need  to  be\nimplemented.\n\nFirst-year  business  economics\nstudent  and  Fir  resident  Alisa  Le\nbelieves  steps  should  be  taken\ntoward ensuring student safety.\n\nWe  should  get  a  system  like\nSproul  and  the  other  high-rise\ndorms  where  we  have  a  check-in\n\ndesk, Le said.\n\nthe \n\nStudents  interested  in  joining  the\nSafety and Security Committee can\nsite,\nvisit \nwww.orl.ucla.edu/security, \nfor\nmore  information.
